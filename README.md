will add stuff to the project as I go on



how to play: arrow keys to move the blue box towards the yellow box (goal). the red box kills you if you touch it, and it moves left to right in the middle of the screen at a consistant rate. if player touches yellow box, the yellow box instantly teleports somewhere else away from the player. the position where the yellow box teleports is random. the yellow box's dimensions also change each time it gets touched and teleports.
